# Bob wants to create a guessing number game! 
# Rule 1: Numbers have to be between 1 and 20
# Rule 2: Program must run until the correct number is guessed
# Rule 3: When guessed right, print out how many tries to guess the 
# right number. Example: "Yes! You guessed it in ___ guesses."
# Rule 4: The program will tell you if your number needs to be HIGHER
# or LOWER 
# until the number is guessed correctly and the program ENDS.
# Remeber to import the random function
#Bonus objective can you put it into a loop to make the game end after 3 turns?
