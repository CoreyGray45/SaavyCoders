# Write a program that works out whether if a given number is an 
# odd or even number
# 🚨 Don't change the code below 👇
number = int(input("Which number do you want to check? "))
# 🚨 Don't change the code above 👆

#Write your code below this line 👇

if number % 2 == 0:
    print("Your number is even.")
else:
    print ("Your number is odd.")




# Create a program using maths and f-Strings that tells us how many 
# days, weeks, months we have left if we live until 90 years old.

# It will take your current age as the input and output a message 
# with our time left in this format:

# You have x days, y weeks, and z months left.

# Where x, y and z are replaced with the actual calculated numbers.


# 🚨 Don't change the code below 👇
age = int(input("What is your current age? "))
# 🚨 Don't change the code above 👆

#Write your code below this line 👇

years_left = 90 - age
days_left = years_left * 365
weeks_left = years_left * 52
months_left = years_left * 12

print(f"You have {days_left} days, {weeks_left} weeks, and {months_left} months left until you turn 90 years old.")
